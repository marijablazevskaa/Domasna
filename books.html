  <h3>"Пиреј" by Петре М. Андреевски</h3>
  <p class="b1"> This book is my favorite novel I've ever read because of the style in which it's written and the symbolism it carries;the author illustrates his
    invincible nation through the three-leaved reed grass. The time of its occurrence is the Balkan Wars, the First World War and the years after. Spouses Ion and Velika tell about their lives in chapters that are constantly changing and show how they are almost crushed between political upheavals, property claims and disputes.</p>

  <h3>"The Stranger" by Albert Camus</h3>

  <p class="b">This book is for you if you wish to explore deeper into the concept of absurdism and the questions regarding the meaning of life. The Stranger was written by Camus to describe the Absurdist ideology, and that each
    person must come to terms with the apathy and meaninglessness of life on their own terms.
    Meursault, the protagonist of the novel The Stranger by Albert Camus, goes through life as a French man in colonial Algeria feeling isolated and detached from the people and events around him.</p>

  <h3>"Crime and Punishment" by Fyodor Dostoevsky</h3>

  <p class="b">The novel is a psychological analysis of the poor former student Raskolnikov, whose theory that he is an extraordinary person able to take on the spiritual responsibility of using evil means to achieve humanitarian ends leads him to murder. The act produces nightmarish guilt in Raskolnikov. The story is one of the finest studies of the psychopathology of guilt written in any language.</p>

  <h3>"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer" by	Patrick Süskind </h3>

  <p class="b">If you want to read a thriller with an intriguing plot, this book is for you! The story follows Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, an unloved orphan in 18th-century France who is born with an exceptional sense of smell, capable of distinguishing a vast range of scents in the world around him. Grenouille becomes a perfumer but later becomes involved in murder when he encounters a young girl with an unsurpassed wondrous scent. </p>

  <h3>"Бели Мугри" by Кочо Рацин</h3>

  <p class="b">According to the lyrical style, the poems in "Бели Мугри" contain a social character and have the following themes: mercantile, migrant, about unsuccessful trades, elegiac, and revolutionary.
    The title of the collection of poems is symbolic—a
    landscape desired by workers, argots, and all exploited people. It is a new morning, a new beginning, a new life in which everyone will be equal.</p>

  <h3>"The Reader" by Bernhard Schlink</h3>

  <p class="b1">I found "The Reader" fascinating; though the plot may seem simple, the questions it raises are anything but. When he falls ill on his way home from school, fifteen-year-old Michael Berg is rescued by Hanna,
    a woman twice his age. In time she becomes his lover--then she inexplicably disappears. When Michael next sees her, he is a young
    law student, and she is on trial for a hideous crime. Michael gradually realizes that Hanna may be guarding a secret she considers more shameful than murder.</p>
